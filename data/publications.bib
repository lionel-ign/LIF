	abstract = {Multisource forest inventory methods were developed to improve the precision of national forest inventory estimates. These methods rely on the combination of inventory data and auxiliary information correlated with forest attributes of interest. As these methods have been predominantly tested over coniferous forests, the present study used this approach for heterogeneous and complex deciduous forests in the center of France. The auxiliary data considered included a forest type map, Landsat 8 spectral bands and derived vegetation indexes, and 3D variables derived from photogrammetric canopy height models. On a subset area, changes in canopy height estimated from two successive photogrammetric models were also used. A model-assisted inference framework, using a k nearest-neighbors approach, was used to predict 11 field inventory variables simultaneously. The results showed that among the auxiliary variables tested, 3D metrics improved the precision of dendrometric estimates more than other auxiliary variables. Relative efficiencies (RE) varying from 2.15 for volume to 1.04 for stand density were obtained using all auxiliary variables. Canopy height changes also increased RE from 3\% to 26\%. Our results confirmed the importance of 3D metrics as auxiliary variables and demonstrated the value of canopy change variables for increasing the precision of estimates of forest structural attributes such as density and quadratic mean diameter.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanners provide accurate and detailed point clouds of forest plots, which can be used as an alternative to destructive measurements during forest inventories. Various specialized algorithms have been developed to provide automatic and objective estimates of forest attributes from point clouds. The STEP (Snakes for Tuboid Extraction from Point cloud) algorithm was developed to estimate both stem diameter at breast height and stem diameters along the bole length. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of this algorithm and compare its performance with two other state-of-the-art algorithms that were designed for the same purpose (i.e., the CompuTree and SimpleTree algorithms). We tested each algorithm against point clouds that incorporated various degrees of noise and occlusion. We applied these algorithms to three contrasting test sites: (1) simulated scenes of coniferous stands in Newfoundland (Canada), (2) test sites of deciduous stands in Phalsbourg (France), and (3) coniferous plantations in Quebec, Canada. In most cases, the STEP algorithm predicted diameter at breast height with higher R2 and lower RMSE than the other two algorithms. The STEP algorithm also achieved greater accuracy when estimating stem diameter in occluded and noisy point clouds, with mean errors in the range of 1.1 cm to 2.28 cm. The CompuTree and SimpleTree algorithms respectively produced errors in the range of 2.62 cm to 6.1 cm and 1.03 cm to 3.34 cm, respectively. Unlike CompuTree or SimpleTree, the STEP algorithm was not able to estimate trunk diameter in the uppermost portions of the trees. Our results show that the STEP algorithm is more adapted to extract DBH and stem diameter automatically from occluded and noisy point clouds. Our study also highlights that SimpleTree and CompuTree require data filtering and results corrections. Conversely, none of these procedures were applied for the implementation of the STEP algorithm.},

To accomplish this task, our approach builds upon a known a priori model that coarsely describes the scanned object to guide the modeling of the shape based on heavily occluded point clouds. In the region of space visible to the scanner, we retrieve the surface by following the resolution of a Poisson problem: the surface is modeled as the zero level-set of an implicit function whose gradient is the closest to the vector field induced by the 3D sample normals. In the occluded region of space, we consider the a priori model as a sufficiently accurate descriptor of the shape. Both models, which are expressed in the same basis of compactly supported radial functions to ensure computation and memory efficiency, are then blended to obtain a closed model of the scanned object. Our method is finally tested on traditional testing datasets to assess its accuracy and on simulated terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) point clouds of trees to assess its ability to handle complex shapes with occlusions.},

	abstract = {Combining national forest inventory (NFI) data with auxiliary information allows downscaling and improving the precision of NFI estimates for small domains, where normally too few field plots are available to produce reliable estimates. In most situations, small domains represent administrative units that could greatly vary in size and forested area. In small and poorly sampled domains, the precision of estimates often drop below expected standards. To tackle this issue, we introduce a downscaling algorithm generating the smallest possible groups of domains satisfying prescribed sampling density and estimation error. The binary space partitioning algorithm recursively divides the population of domains in two groups while the prescribed precision conditions are fulfilled. The algorithm was tested on two major forest attributes (i.e. growing stock and basal area) in an area of 7,500 km2 dominated by hardwood forests in the centre of France. The estimation domains consisted in 157 municipalities. The field data included 819 NFI plots surveyed during a 5 years period. The auxiliary data consisted in 48 metrics derived from a forest map, photogrammetric models and Landsat images. A model-assisted framework was used for estimation. For each forest attribute, the best model was selected using a best-subset approach using a Bayesian Information Criteria. The retained models explained 58\% and 41\% of the observed variance for the growing stocks and basal areas respectively. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using a minimum of 3 NFI points per domain and estimation errors varying from 10 to 50\%. For a target estimation error set to 10\%, the algorithm led to a limited number of estimation domains ({\textless}23 for both attributes) of large size ({\textasciitilde}15,000 ha) having an average estimation error lower than 7.7\% for both attributes. Relaxing the targeted error threshold to 50\% led to a larger amount of smaller domains (80 domains of 4,176 ha in average) for both attributes, and maximum estimation errors reaching 42.8\%. Among those domains 65\% consisted in single municipalities. For the sake of comparison, the estimation was also conducted at the scale of municipalities. Out of the 157 municipalities studied, only 93 were sampled with at least 3 NFI points and therefore estimated. Missing values were generated for the remaining 64 municipalities. Average errors of 15.9\% and 15.6\% were obtained for growing stock and basal area respectively, but estimation errors greater than 50\% were obtained for some municipalities. The algorithm provides a flexible estimation framework for small area estimation. The key advantages of the approach are relying on its capacity to produce estimations based on a preselected precision threshold and to produce results over the whole area of interest, avoiding areas without any estimates. The algorithm could also be used on any kind of polygon layers (not only administrative ones), provided that the field sampling design enable estimation. This makes the proposed algorithm a convenient tool notably for decision makers and forest managers.},

First, we introduced point normalization based on penetration depth below the outer canopy layer to avoid biases introduced by ground normalization and canopy surface heterogeneity during metric computation. Second, we proposed computation of area and volume metrics from canopy surface models computed from both first and last returns to better characterize the 3D plot heterogeneity. The set of proposed metrics were combined with traditional ones, based on point height above ground level, to measure their contribution to models of basal area (BA) and aboveground volume (AGV). The modeling framework included a wide range of forest types, canopy structures and Lidar characteristics. Models were developed for all sites grouped together or separately. In each case, the set of metrics was submitted to a hierarchical clustering process to select the best variables to be included in the models that were further established using a best-subset method. Overall, the introduction of the proposed metrics allowed a reduction in models root mean squared error from −0.06\% to 19.58\% according to forest types and target forest parameters. Best improvements were achieved for broadleaved forests, showing the potential of the proposed metrics to efficiently characterize the structure of such porous forest canopies.},

	abstract = {Forest map products are widely used and have taken benefit from progresses in the multisource forest inventory approaches, which are meant to improve the precision of forest inventory estimates at high spatial resolution. However, estimating errors of pixel-wise predictions remains difficult, and reconciling statistical outcomes with map products is still an open and important question. We address this problem using an original approach relying on a model-based inference framework and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) models to produce pixel-wise estimations and related quality assessment. Our approach takes advantage of the resampling properties of a model-based estimator and combines it with geometrical convex-hull models to measure respectively the precision and accuracy of pixel predictions. A measure of pixel reliability was obtained by combining precision and accuracy. The study was carried out over a 7,694 km2 area dominated by structurally complex broadleaved forests in centre of France. The targeted forest attributes were growing stock volume, basal area and growing stock volume increment. A total of 819 national forest inventory plots were combined with auxiliary data extracted from a forest map, Landsat 8 images, and 3D point clouds from both airborne laser scanning and digital aerial photogrammetry. k-NN models were built independently for both 3D data sources. Both selected models included 5 auxiliary variables, and were generated using 5 neighbours, and most similar neighbours distance measure. The models showed relative root mean square error ranging from 35.7\% (basal area, digital aerial photogrammetry) in calibration to 63.4\% (growing stock volume increment, airborne laser scanning) in the validation set. At pixel level, we found that a minimum of 86.4\% of the predictions were of high precision as their bootstrapped coefficient of variation fall below calibration’s relative root mean square error. The amount of extrapolation varied from 4.3\% (digital aerial photogrammetry) to 6.3\% (airborne laser scanning). A relationship was found between extrapolation and k-NN distance, opening new opportunities to correct extrapolation errors. At the population level, airborne laser scanning and digital aerial photogrammetry performed similarly, offering the possibility to use digital aerial photogrammetry for monitoring purposes. The proposed method provided consistent estimates of forest attributes and maps, and also provided spatially explicit information about pixel predictions in terms of precision, accuracy and reliability. The method therefore produced high resolution outputs, significant for either decision making or forest management purposes.},

	abstract = {The French National Forest Inventory provides detailed forest information up to large national and regional scales. Forest inventory for small areas of interest within a large population is equally important for decision making, such as for local forest planning and management purposes. However, sampling these small areas with sufficient ground plots is often not cost efficient. In response, small area estimation has gained increasing popularity in forest inventory. It consists of a set of techniques that enables predictions of forest attributes of subpopulation with the help of auxiliary information that compensates for the small field samples. Common sources of auxiliary information usually come from remote sensing technology, such as airborne laser scanning and satellite imagery. The newly launched NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a full waveform Lidar instrument, provides an unprecedented opportunity of collecting large-scale and dense forest sample plots given its sampling frequency and spatial coverage. However, the geolocation uncertainty associated with GEDI footprints create important challenges for their use for small area estimations. In this study, we designed a process that provides NFI measurements at plot level with GEDI auxiliary information from nearby footprints. We demonstrated that GEDI RH98 is equivalent to NFI dominant height at plot level. We stressed the importance of pairing NFI plots with nearby GEDI footprints, based on not only the distance in between but also their similarities, i.e., forest heights and forest types. Subsequently, these NFI-GEDI pairs were used for small area estimations following a two-phase sampling scheme. We showcased that, with an adequate sample size, small area estimation with GEDI auxiliary data can improve the accuracy of forest volume estimates.},

	abstract = {The contribution of forests to carbon storage and biodiversity conservation highlights the need for accurate forest height and biomass mapping and monitoring. In France, forests are managed mainly by private owners and divided into small stands, requiring 10 to 50 m spatial resolution data to be correctly separated. Further, 35 \% of the French forest territory is covered by mountains and Mediterranean forests which are managed very extensively. In this work, we used a deep-learning model based on multi-stream remote-sensing measurements (NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar mission and ESA's Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites) to create a 10 m resolution canopy height map of France for 2020 (FORMS-H). In a second step, with allometric equations fitted to the French National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data, we created a 30 m resolution above-ground biomass density (AGBD) map (Mg ha−1) of France (FORMS-B). Extensive validation was conducted. First, independent datasets from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and NFI data from thousands of plots reveal a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.94 m for FORMS-H, which outperforms existing canopy height models. Second, FORMS-B was validated using two independent forest inventory datasets from the Renecofor permanent forest plot network and from the GLORIE forest inventory with MAE of 59.6 and 19.6 Mg ha−1, respectively, providing greater performance than other AGBD products sampled over France. Finally, we compared FORMS-V (for volume) with wood volume estimations at the ecological region scale and obtained an R2 of 0.63 with an MAE of 30 m3 ha−1. These results highlight the importance of coupling remote-sensing technologies with recent advances in computer science to bring material insights to climate-efficient forest management policies. Additionally, our approach is based on open-access data having global coverage and a high spatial and temporal resolution, making the maps reproducible and easily scalable.

	abstract = {The population of forest trees having no sampling frame, forest inventories have relied on indirect sampling methods. This indirect sampling uses two populations: the discrete populations of trees and the continuous population of points, from which trees are being sampled. Important works such as Mandallaz (1991), Eriksson (1995) and Stevens and Urquhart (2000) brought the fundamental elements in the formalization of the sampling of trees, by defining the duality principle that relates both populations. They led to the so-called continuous population approach where trees attributes are transformed into attribute density values. However, in these approaches, the trees quickly fade away despite being the target population while their weight is calculated as the inverse of their inclusion probability. We explain how the Generalized Weight Share Method (GWSM) can be used to formalize the link between the two populations. GWSM allows to revisit previous concepts proposed to solve the question of how to produce estimations from tree-level attributes, under uniform random or more complex sampling designs. The principles of the method are explained, and its functioning is illustrated under a variety of points and trees sampling designs, including fixed-area, Bitterlich and cluster sampling.},

	abstract = {Aims Spatially balanced sampling is the most efficient method for surveying continuous and spatially structured populations. The spatial sampling of large-scale surveys is mostly based on grids whose properties drive and potentially limit the possibility of building flexible samples. Periodicity causes high sampling constraints when an increase in the frequency of information delivery is sought. The sampling stratification of the adaptive sampling intensity also conflicts with the grid-based approach. Although some surveys seemingly exploit these properties, no formal developments have been made available in the survey sampling literature across the fields of application. Methods We define and demonstrate the geometric properties of square grids, demonstrate how they can be used to produce nested hierarchical grids compatible with multiple periodicity values of interest for natural monitoring, and adapt the sampling intensity across space and time. A simulation study was conducted to quantify how spatial balance can be traded slowly for sample size reduction. Results We showed that square grids have geometric properties that can be exploited to cope with spatial flexibility in the sampling effort and the spatiotemporal coordination of samples. We also provide an original extension of this framework intended to tune the sampling effort gradually while preserving spatial systematicity. The simulation study showed that a nested hierarchical grid can be used to progressively reduce the sampling intensity while preserving regularity in the spatial arrangement of units. Conclusions We demonstrate the flexibility and diversity of sampling schemes that can be implemented with square grids, answering the need for periodicity and the coordination of multiple samples and the limits of their use.},

Within the selected cells, additional random sampling of points is conducted. Subsequently, classification of the selected points is performed using auxiliary information from photo-interpretation. This information is used to draw a sub-sample that leads to field measurements. We evaluate the efficiency of the French NFI’s sampling design when the Horvitz–Thompson and post-stratified estimators for the total are used in the first and second phases, respectively. Given the complexity of the French NFI’s sampling design, a new theoretical framework is introduced for two-stage two-phase sampling schemes to facilitate design-based inference, combining inference methods for both finite and continuous populations. Horvitz–Thompson type estimators for the total and post-stratified estimators are proposed alongside variance estimators. Their performances are assessed through a simulation study, comparing the French NFI’s sampling design using alternative methods. The results indicate that the strategy formed by the French NFIs sampling design and proposed estimators may be effective in practice.

	abstract = {The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission can significantly enhance multisource national forest inventories (MSNFI) by improving the spatio-temporal resolution of forest attributes while preserving the statistical relevance of the design-based inference approach. The main challenge is the lack of systematic spatial alignment between GEDI footprints and National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots, which is necessary to accurately link in situ forest measurements with GEDI data. In this study, we aim to tackle the aforementioned issue by introducing a methodology for interpolating GEDI measurements to NFI plots, enabling the calibration of GEDI data using localized NFI estimates. Our proposed method incorporates clustering, classification, and regression techniques, and utilizes GEDI and NFI data, along with Sentinel-2 images, land-use information, and topographic data. Beginning with the prediction of profile structural classes and shapes on NFI plots, the proposed method ultimately projects actual measurements onto the NFI plot sites through profile pairing within the predicted structural classes. The method is conceived and validated using the data acquired across the mountainous area of {\textbackslash}sim 500 kha, covered by {\textgreater}500 NFI plots. Our validation framework shows that the method is able to project relative height profiles at NFI plots, allowing to partly interpolate the lower part of the profile and not only the canopy top height. This enables the construction of models that efficiently relate GEDI profiles and wood volume, demonstrating the importance of incorporating lower relative height values when linking forest attributes and lidar measurements (R{\textasciicircum}2=0.65, MBE=2.31 m$^{\textrm{3}}$/ha).},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The development of high-resolution mapping models for forest attributes based on remote sensing data combined with machine or deep learning techniques, has become a prominent topic in the field of forest observation and monitoring. This has resulted in an extensive availability of multiple sources of information, which can either lead to a potential confusion, or to the possibility to learn both about models and about forest attributes through the joint interpretation of multiple models. This article seeks to endorse the latter, by relying on the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, which can be used to diagnose and interpret differences among predictions of different models. The predictions in our case are the forest canopy height estimations for the metropolitan France coming from five different models (Lang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Morin et al., 2022; Potapov et al., 2021; Schwartz et al., 2024). An independent reference dataset, containing four different definitions of the forest height (dominant, mean, maximum and Lorey\&rsquo;s), comes from the French National Forest Inventory (NFI) providing some 5 500 plots used in the study, distributed across the entire area of interest. In this contribution, we line up the evoked models with respect to their probabilities to be the ones generating measurements/estimations at the NFI plots. Stratifying the probabilities based on French sylvo-ecological regions reveals spatial variation in the respective model probabilities across the area of interest. Furthermore, we observe significant variability in these probabilities depending on the forest height definition used. This leads us to infer that the different models inadvertently exhibit dominant predictions for different types of canopy height. We also present the respective inter-model and intra-model variance estimations, allowing us to come to understand where the employed models have comparable weights but contrasted predictions. We show that the mountainous terrain has an important impact on the models spread. Moreover, we observe that the forest stand vertical structure, the dominant tree species and the type of forest ownership systematically appear to be statistically significant factors influencing the models divergence. Finally, we demonstrate that the derived mixture models exhibit higher {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{2}}$ scores and lower {\textless}em{\textgreater}RMSE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} values compared to individual models, although they may not necessarily exhibit lower biases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and Mobile laser scanning (MLS) have already shown high potential in further advancing forest inventory development. By enabling the retrieval of new forest attributes in addition to traditional ones, these technologies could drive forest inventories into a new paradigm by introducing innovative approaches to measuring and monitoring forests. The debate on the possible implementation of TLS and MLS in forest inventories, particularly in national forest inventories (NFIs), continues in both the scientific community and the public institutions. To date, few studies have evaluated the application of TLS and MLS technologies in large-scale forest inventories or assessed their practical operational limits. In this practice-oriented paper, we first detail TLS and MLS data acquisition and processing for tree attribute estimation, assessing their maturity and main limitations. We then explore three European case studies—from the French, Finnish, and Swiss National Forest Inventories (NFIs)—where these technologies have been tested. Based on these experiences, we identify the main constraints and challenges for operational implementation. Lastly, we discuss the prospects for TLS and MLS within the NFI context and the requirements for their successful adoption. We conclude that TLS and MLS should be viewed not as a replacement for, but as a complement to and enhancement of, traditional NFI practices. Emphasis should be placed on the new opportunities these technologies offer, rather than on direct comparisons with conventional methods.},

	abstract = {This study presents a k-nearest neighbor bagging approach for predicting forest attributes, specifically growing stock volume (GSV), by integrating optical Sentinel-2, radar Sentinel-1, and spaceborne lidar GEDI datasets following a two-step procedure. Over a large region (∼ 4600 km2), some selected GEDI variables were imputed to national forest inventory (NFI) plots, then models were developed to predict GSV based on the combined imputed GEDI and Sentinel variables. For GEDI imputation, three strategies were followed, each one using different auxiliary datasets: (A) solely relying on Sentinel data, (B) using Sentinel data complemented by maximum height values from both GEDI and NFI data sources, (C) using Sentinel and height values from an independent canopy height map derived from GEDI and Sentinel through Deep Learning. For each strategy, the models were built using a k-nearest neighbor approach and evaluated on an independent test dataset. The results indicated that the ability of Strategy A to predict forest volume as the percentage of explained variance (R2) was considerably limited (0.08) and the relative root mean squared error (RMSE\%) was high (66\%). Upon adding heights, Strategy B outperformed the previous strategy, with a R2 of 0.58 and a relatively low RMSE\% (43\%). Compared to Strategy A, the use of estimated heights from a canopy height map improved predictions, but did not outperform Strategy B; R2 was 0.34 and RMSE\% 53\%. Imputations yielded better models when using original GEDI footprint heights as inputs, rather than relying on height estimates extracted from the canopy height map. Therefore, small area model-assisted estimation may be preferred over wall-to-wall maps to reduce area-based local estimation errors.},

	abstract = {High-resolution mapping of forest attributes is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and carbon budget assessments. Recent advancements have leveraged satellite imagery and deep learning algorithms to generate high-resolution forest height maps. While these maps provide valuable snapshots of forest conditions, they lack the temporal resolution to estimate forest-related carbon fluxes or track annual changes. Few studies have produced annual forest height, volume, or biomass change maps validated at the forest stand level. To address this limitation, we developed a deep learning framework, coupling data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2) and from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission, to generate a time series of forest height, growing stock volume, and aboveground biomass at 10 to 30-m spatial resolution that we refer to as FORMS-T (FORest Multiple Satellite Time series). Unlike previous studies, we train our model on individual S2 scenes, rather than on growing season composites, to account for acquisition variability and improve generalization across years. We produced these maps for France over seven years (2018–2024) for height at 10 m resolution and further converted them to 30 m maps of growing stock volume and aboveground biomass using leaf type-specific allometric equations. Evaluation against the French National Forest Inventory (NFI) showed an average mean absolute error of 3.07 m for height (r2=0.68) across all years, 86 m3 ha-1 for volume and 65.1 Mg ha-1 for biomass. We further evaluated FORMS-T capacity to capture growth on a site where two successive airborne laser scanning (ALS) campaigns were available, showing a good agreement with ALS data when aggregating at coarser spatial resolution (r2=0.60, MAE=0.27 m for the 2020–2022 growth of trees between 10 and 15 m in 5 km pixels). Additionally, we compared our results to the NFI-based wood volume production at regional level and obtained a good agreement with a MAE of 1.45 m3 ha-1 yr-1 and r2 of 0.59. We then leveraged our height change maps to derive species-specific growth curves and compared them to ground-based measurements, highlighting distinct growth dynamics and regional variations in forest management practices. Further development of such maps could contribute to the assessment of forest-related carbon stocks and fluxes, contributing to the formulation of a comprehensive carbon budget at the country scale, and supporting global efforts to mitigate climate change.},

	abstract = {Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) tare major European conifers undergoing severe dieback. Large-scale, high-frequency monitoring with multispectral satellites using Sentinel-2 images and ground observations (2018-2023) over the French mountains for 742 pure and 949 mixed stands, we investigated the interest of analysing dieback detection at the species level. We used time series analysis from seven raw bands and eight vegetation indices and integrated spectral anomalies for different periods prior to the ground survey. Results differed among species: silver fir was best detected with a 15-month period and Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI), Norway Spruce with a 1-month period and Continuum removal of the shortwave-infrared spectrum (CRSWIR), and Scots pine with a 4-month period and red-edge (CRRE). In pure stands, dieback detection was most accurate for Norway spruce (R2 = 0.54, OA = 77\%) followed by silver fir (R2 = 0.34, OA = 61\%) and Scots pine (R2 = 0.16, OA = 64\%). Dieback was difficult to detect in its early stages and in mixtures, mainly for Norway spruce and Scots pine. This study highlights the importance of developing species-specific methods for large-area monitoring of dieback.},

Certain data, linked to forest attributes, can be used to increase the precision of forest inventories and to produce estimates at much finer scales than before. A multi-source approach to inventorying thus emerged in Finland in the 1990s and has been developed in France over the last few years. Considerable gains in precision can be expected for decision-makers and managers.
Highlights:- Multi-source inventory allows decision-makers and managers to choose their desired precision and resolution when estimating forest attributes.- This approach has been implemented in the Sologne and Vosges forests by the National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information (IGN)},

	abstract = {Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a lidar system on-board the International Space Station designed to study forest ecosystems. However, GEDI footprint low accuracy geolocation is a major impediment to the optimal benefit of the data. We thus proposed a geolocation correction method, GeoGEDI, only based on high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and GEDI derived ground elevations. For each footprint, an error map between GEDI ground estimates and reference DEM was computed, and a flow accumulation algorithm was used to retrieve the optimal footprint position. GeoGEDI was tested on 150 000 footprints in Landes and Vosges, two French forests with various stands and topographic conditions. It was applied to GEDI versions 1 (v1) and 2 (v2), by either a single or four full-power laser beam tracks. GeoGEDI output accuracy was evaluated by analyzing shift distributions and comparing GEDI ground elevations and surface heights to reference data. GeoGEDI corrections were greater for v1 than for v2 and agreed with errors published by NASA. Within forests, GeoGEDI improved the root mean square error (RMSE) of ground elevation in Landes by 26.8\% (0.34 m) and by 13.3\% (0.14 m) for v1 and v2, respectively. For Vosges, ground elevation RMSE improved by 59.6\% (3.82 m) and 36.2\% (1.41 m), for v1 and v2, respectively. Regarding surface heights, except for v2 in Landes, where insufficient variations in topography combined to GEDI ground detection issues might have penalized the adjustment, GeoGEDI improved GEDI estimates. Using GeoGEDI showed efficient to improve positioning bias and precision.},

	abstract = {The definition of statistical units is a recurring issue in the domain of sample surveys. Indeed, not all the populations surveyed have a readily available sampling frame. For some populations, the sampled units are distinct from the observation units and producing estimates on the population of interest raises complex questions, which can be addressed by using the weight share method (Deville and Lavallée, 2006). However, the two populations considered in this approach are discrete. In some fields of study, the sampled population is continuous: this is for example the case of forest inventories for which, frequently, the trees surveyed are those located on plots of which the centers are points randomly drawn in a given area. The production of statistical estimates from the sample of trees surveyed poses methodological difficulties, as do the associated variance calculations. The purpose of this paper is to generalize the weight share method to the continuous (sampled population) ? discrete (surveyed population) case, from the extension proposed by Cordy (1993) of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for drawing points carried out in a continuous universe.},

The study highlights the importance of considering the scope of validity of the models and of quantifying the uncertainties.
Highlights:
Models that have been calibrated using remote sensing data from large forest areas are not necessarily applicable locally.

The results show the mixtures to have higher average stability but no systematic superiority relative to the associated monocultures. A correlation study allowed two dimensions of resilience to be identified. The present study underlines the potential for national monitoring via inventory to evaluate the resilience of mixed forests.
Highlights:- Mixed stands show higher productive stability than monocultures due to a lower frequency of years in which productivity was exceptionally high.- No general advantage of mixtures over the monocultures is observed.- The national forest inventory is a relevant tool for monitoring the resilience of forests to changes in climate.},

Wood density was measured on 110,763 wood cores sampled at breast height over the period 2016–2019 on 20,697 NFI plots evenly distributed across mainland France. The dataset covers 156 European tree species and wide gradients of elevations (from 0 to 2,300 m above sea level), climates (oceanic, continental, mountain and Mediterranean climates) and soil conditions. It encompasses most European forest types, with the exception of boreal forests. The number of wood density measurements is roughly proportional to the abundance of tree species in the forest area sampled.

Despite substantial historical afforestation efforts, exotic tree species only represent 8.7\% of the forest area, and minor the anthropic capacity to severely change the tree species composition of forests. Tree species showing a strong annual extension would deserve an indepth screening of their spatial distribution and analysis of the processes at play. Exotic species are also found in a majority of forest habitats of the European Union, with a significant abundance in a restricted number of habitats.

	abstract = {Quantitative structure models (QSMs) are topological ordered cylinder models of trees which cover the complete branching structure from the stem’s base up to all tips. But the thin branches appear too large in the input point clouds. This leads to a well known problem, the overestimation of the QSM cylinders’ volumes and radii in thin branches. We present here a solution to this problem by introducing two QSM filters correcting the radii of such cylinders. The filters itself are build upon the theoretical fundamentals of allometric scaling theories. For validation we use QSMs produced from an open point cloud data set of tree clouds with the SimpleForest software. We compare the QSM volume against the harvested reference data for 65 felled trees.

	abstract = {The bundle of forest landowners’ rights largely varies from one jurisdiction to another. On a global scale, the diversity of forest management regime and property rights systems is such that finding comprehensive and standardised approaches for governance analysis purposes is a challenging task. This paper explores the use of the Property Rights Index for Forestry (PRIF) as an analytical tool based on five rights domains (access, withdrawal, management, exclusion, and alienation) to assess how regulatory frameworks impact the owners’ forest property rights. We show that PRIF is a reliable index for various governance arrangements, considering its ability to score forest owners’ freedom to decide in case studies that range from the Amazon area (Brazil), Misiones province (Argentina) and Quebec (Canada) to community-managed Nepalese and Mexican forests. PRIF scores obtained in these diverse governance arrangements confirm that the governance of forests held by entities other than the state is driven by two factors: the owner’s ability to exclude the public from the use of his/her own resource and the owner’s freedom to decide on the forest management goals. These factors explained 66.44\% of the variance in our sample and should be considered as the main potential drivers while implementing any new international or national policy. Despite having a few limitations, the PRIF is a promising governance indicator and has been proven to perform well for various socioeconomic and legal contexts.},

Parameter variances and distributions were further modeled to serve as a plug-in option to any inventory-based initial condition. Forty-year time series of observed forest growing stock were compared with model simulations to balance model uncertainty and bias. Variance models showed high accuracies. The Gamma distribution best fitted the distributions of transition, mortality and felling rates, while the Gaussian distribution best fitted tree recruitment fluxes. Simulation uncertainty amounted to 12\% of the model bias at the country scale. Parameter covariance structure increased simulation uncertainty by 5.5\% in this 12\%.

The discovery of large-scale phenomena operating at extreme scales has substantiated the deep and real times of forests. This new perception has been supported by the emergence and the development of systems for systematic observation and monitoring of forests. These systems have rapidly evolved on a human scale, and benefited from advances in survey statistics, remote sensing, and their coupling. However, a historical approach shows that they constantly lag behind the real phenomena at play in forests, as illustrated by global processes of a significant magnitude like forest growth changes, forest transitions, or environmental disturbances. Being able to build a vision of the future for these observation systems represents a major technological and societal challenge in the face of climate warming.

	abstract = {National Forest Inventories (NFIs) perform systematic forest surveys across space and time. They are hence powerful tools to understand climate controls on forest growth at wide geographical scales and account for the effects of local abiotic and biotic interactions. To investigate the effects of climate change upon growth dynamics of four major European conifer species along elevation and continentality gradients, we herein provide an original harmonization of the French and Austrian NFI datasets. The growth of Norway spruce, Scots pine, silver fir and European larch over the 1996–2016 period was studied in pure and even-aged plots across different ecological regions. We derived climate-driven growth trends from {\textgreater} 65, 000 radial increment series filtered out from major biotic and abiotic influences using statistical modeling. We further identified primary environmental drivers of conifer growth by regressing growth trends against regionally aggregated biotic and abiotic forest attributes. Negative growth trends were observed in continental regions undergoing the most rapid warming and thermal amplitude contraction over the study period. Negative trends were also associated with lower forest structural heterogeneity and, surprisingly, with greater available water capacity. Remarkably, we observed these associations both at the inter- and intra-species levels, suggesting the universality of these primary growth determinants. Our study shows that harmonized NFI data at the transnational level provide reliable information on climate–growth interactions. Here, greater forest structural complexity and greater water resource limitation were highlighted as drivers of greater forest resilience to climate change at large-scale. This result forms crucial bases to implementing climate-smart forest management.},

The present screening of Forest Europe 2015 statistics explored the features, inertia and limits of this expansion, and its relationships with countries’ development, forest management and trade, intense in this area of the world. Persisting footprint of past demographic pressure on forests was identified, with opposed traces on their area and growing stock density. Steady growing stock (GS) increases, proportional to GS, not density-limited, and sustained by forest area increases, supported the view of an inflationary forest dynamic. Economic development and liberalism fostered both forest exploitation and production, yielding no significant impact on GS changes. Wood exports exerted a tension on forest exploitation and GS changes, thus lowering GS inflation but providing a resource security margin in the face of expected climate threats. Conflicting a common view, GS inflation and moderate felling-to-increment ratios make increased use of wood resources and C sequestration reconcilable, and GS expansion timely for ongoing EU forest policy processes. Anticipated adverse impacts of ongoing climate change were not clearly identified in these statistics.},

Despite recent concerns regarding their greater sensitivity to major natural disturbances, their impacts on biodiversity and their funding efficiency, PEA conifer forests could remain a major economic target given the ongoing European strategy for bioeconomy. These forests are encountered in contrasted climates and in both native and introduced contexts across Europe, giving rise to high uncertainties regarding their growth responses to current climate change. Using the French National Forest Inventory data, we studied the radial growth of eight major conifer species in European forestry across 16 regional native and introduced PEA forest systems (n {\textgreater} 10 000 trees). Growth trends over the 2006–2016 period exhibited a significant negative association with the absolute growth level in 2006, with the strongest negative growth trends found for emblematic PEA forestry species (e.g. Norway spruce and Douglas fir), and the strongest positive trends for pine species (e.g. Scots pine). While the greater growth rate advantage of some species may shorten rotation and lower risk exposures for future decades, their recent lowered productivity may affect the forest sector in the long run. The prevalence of PEA forests across European forest landscapes and their increasingly reported lower resilience to climate change compared to more complex forest systems call for the establishment of a long-term European forest policy strategy. Maintaining the environmental, social and economic benefits of forests should remain a priority in the European agenda, regardless of the financial costs at stake.},

Moreover, the comparison with data on harvested volumes from different sources brought contrasted results depending on the source. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that wood harvest increased in France in 2016–2018 compared to 2004–2015.

However, huge intraspecific variation in wood density (WD) driven by biotic and abiotic environments of tree growth remains ignored in C budgets. The aims of this study were (i) to identify variations in SBR along water, soil nutrition and elevation gradients, (ii) to test for differences between broadleaved and conifer tree species in SBR variations, and (iii) to weight the contributions of interspecific and intraspecific diversity in SBR variations. Analyses were based on massive X-ray WD measurements performed on 54,700 tree cores collected in 2016 and 2017 on the spatially systematic plot sampling design of the French national forest inventory (NFI) programme. Stem biomass ratio (SBR) variations along the three gradients were found to be significant, with differences between botanical classes found on the water gradient only. SBR hence decreased by 73 kg m−3 (conifers) and 126 kg m−3 (broadleaves) along a 180 mm gradient of soil water holding capacity (SWHC), increased by 153 kg m−3 along a full gradient of soil basicity index (SBI), and decreased by 155 kg m−3 from 200 to 2000 m of elevation asl. Species distribution, not intraspecific variation in WD, was found to be the main cause of SBR variation along these gradients. SBR was found to be efficient for analysing large scale vegetation changes along environmental gradients, with interspecific variability being well explained by the three gradients. Mean WD species values were found to suffice to assess these SBR variations at the scale of the French forest resources.},

Capturing tree-growth response to such changes across environmental contexts and tree species calls for a continuous forest monitoring over space. Based on {\textgreater}10,000 tree-ring measurements sampled across the systematic grid of the continuous French national forest inventory (NFI) over the 2006–2016 period, we evaluated the radial growth trends of eight conifer tree species prevalent in European forests across their native and introduced ranges and various bioclimatic contexts (n = 16 forest systems). For each forest system, radial increments were filtered out from tree, plot, soil and climatic normal influences to isolate environment-driven growth signals and quantify residual time-series. Associated growth trends across forest systems were then confronted against environmental variables (e.g. short-term averages and trends in seasonal climate). Trends for a given species were systematically more positive in cooler contexts (higher elevations or northern distribution margins) than in warmer contexts (plains). Decreases and increases in precipitation regimes were found to be associated with negative and positive tree growth trends, respectively. Remarkably, positive growth trends were mainly observed for native forest systems (7/9) and negative trends for introduced systems (5/7). Native forests showed a more heterogeneous forest structure as compared to introduced forests that, in line with observed positive dependence of tree growth trends onto both water availability and forest heterogeneity, appears to modulate the competitive pressure on water resource with ongoing summer maximum temperature increase. Over a short annually-resolved study period, we were able to capture tree growth responses coherent with climate change across diverse forest ecosystems. With ongoing accumulation of data, the continuous French NFI hence arises as powerful support to monitoring climate change effects on forests.},

However, disentangling the effects of climate change on the temporal increase in tree mortality from those of management and forest dynamics remains a challenge. Using a modelling approach taking tree and stand characteristics into account, we sought to evaluate the impact of climate change on background mortality for the most common European tree species. We focused on background mortality, which is the mortality observed in a stand in the absence of abrupt disturbances, to avoid confusion with mortality events unrelated to long-term changes in temperature and rainfall. We studied 372 974 trees including 7312 dead trees from forest inventory data surveyed across France between 2009 and 2015. Factors related to competition, stand characteristics, management intensity, and site conditions were the expected preponderant drivers of mortality. Taking these main drivers into account, we detected a climate change signal on 45\% of the 43 studied species, explaining an average 6\% of the total modelled mortality. For 18 out of the 19 species sensitive to climate change, we evidenced greater mortality with increasing temperature or decreasing rainfall. By quantifying the mortality excess linked to the current climate change for European temperate forest tree species, we provide new insights into forest vulnerability that will prove useful for adapting forest management to future conditions.},

	abstract = {Context
Lowering stand density has been suggested to adapt forests to warmer and drier conditions. Whether common dendrometric rules used to guide growth models and support silviculture are still valid at these densities lower than usual needs be tested. This includes (1) estimating the stand growth-density relationship over wider density gradients (‘Langsaeter’s rule’), (2) testing the stability of site index, and (3) ‘Eichhorn’s rule’ (relating site index to stand growth) at lower densities. Additionally, environmental changes call for a more direct inclusion of environmental drivers in growth models.
Material and methods
We investigated the effects of relative stand density (RDI) on stand growth of even-aged stands of sessile oak. We also analyzed effects of climatic conditions to assess whether sessile oak is already at a critical stage that requires adapting forest management. We used a network of silvicultural trials designed to test the effects of maximum density gradients on stand dynamics along climatic gradients.
Results
As predicted by Langsaeter’s rule, gross stand growth increased with RDI then saturated for RDI {\textgreater} 0.4–0.5, mortality began after crown closure, and diameter increment decreased non-linearly with RDI. Dominant height growth first increased with RDI then saturated for RDI {\textgreater} 0.8. Positive effects of RDI on both stand and height growth caused Eichhorn’s rule to be stable over a large range of RDI (0.25–1). Effects of climate predictors were weak and only visible for radial growth indices. They however suggested antagonistic effects of water and temperature constraints in summer and autumn.
Discussion
Langsaeter’s and Eichhorn’s rules were found valid over a large range of RDI values. We suggest using them to guide growth models and management. However, assumptions behind the use of site index as a proxy for stand productivity were invalidated. Weak and opposed effect of temperature in summer and autumn makes the outcome of climate warming on sessile oak growth uncertain.},

Pinus nigra is a drought-sensitive species and one of the most common and economically important native conifers to Turkey. Tree-ring cores were taken from 61 Pinus nigra plots spread over the entire Lakes District (Southwest Turkey), near the species’ southern range limit. The samples cover the 1839–2013 time period. We apply the Regional Curve Standardization technique and statistical modeling to the tree ring width data to investigate long-term growth trends. Both methods show remarkably similar results: a slowly increasing growth trend until the 1970s, followed by a decreasing trend. This recent negative trend is highly correlated with increased temperature and drought in summer, which suggests that it is likely caused by climate change.},

Between 1975 and 2010, growing stock (+ 59 \%, + 930 million cubic metres) developed three times more quickly than surface area but varied considerably between geographic locations: with area taking the lead in southern France and Brittany while in the Massif Central growing stock was preeminent, pointing to a certain continuity in relation to previous expansion of forest area. Over the same period, private forests and other regulated public forests experienced similar relative surface area variations (+ 20 \%), but private forests accumulated twice as much growing stock (+ 80 \%) as public forests. Between 1987 and 1994, private deciduous forests increased the most (+ 280 000 ha and + 105 million cubic metres), followed by private coniferous forests (+ 60 000 ha and + 63 million cubic metres).

Dendrometric inventory data collected from two networks of silvicultural experimentation were used (LERFOB and GIS Coop networks, 9 sites, 31 plots, 99 inventories, ages from 10 to 120 years). These networks study the effects of a broad range of densities, from freely growing trees (relative density index, or RDI, close to 0) to maximum density situations where self-thinning occurs (RDI equal to or in excess of 1). Climate conditions vary from 660 to 850 mm per year with a heat gradient of 9.5 to 11.5 °C (average 1990-2010). Generally speaking, density very strongly affects tree and stand growth, with drought playing a secondary role that is nonetheless significant. Overtopped trees contribute very little to the growth of the stand, particularly when the stand is dense. Drought reduces growth, particularly that of non-dominant trees. Density and drought therefore have the same effect: they accentuate growth differences between trees when stresses are greater. By allocating more resources to diameter growth as compared to height growth, trees in open stands are more “stocky”. In contrast, in densely populated stands, there is “a race for light” making for greater height growth, especially that of overtopped trees. In all cases, drought has a greater effect in reducing height growth than in reducing diameter growth. Finally, following a particularly severe drought (1976), trees recovered most quickly at the drier sites (recovery in 2 years) while the overtopped trees in the higher density stands recovered very little (still no recovery 7 years later). These results suggest that sessile oak adapts better in drier conditions.},

	abstract = {In the context of rapid climate change, climate-dependent models are essential for assessing species vulnerability. However, variation in model structure and divergence in their predictions introduce substantial uncertainty. Rather than selecting a single “best” model, a more robust strategy is to integrate predictions across models. Bayesian model averaging with Expectation–Maximization (BEM) provides an alternative to simple model averaging (SMA) and weighted model averaging (WMA) for combining ensemble predictions. To date, BEM has been rarely applied to tree species distribution models. We developed a BEM framework for models predicting either species occurrence or proxy variables linked to occurrence. The approach was applied to European beech (Fagus sylvatica) in France, using an ensemble of six models: four species distribution models, one model predicting the probability of hydraulic failure, and one model predicting juvenile productivity. In contrast to SMA and WMA, which assigned similar weights across models, BEM concentrated 85\% of the weight on two models. Furthermore, BEM enabled spatially explicit decomposition of model weights, allowing us to identify regions where predictions diverged most strongly. The resulting probability maps revealed a specific zone in environmental space where model agreement on beech occurrence was particularly limited. Focusing on this zone may help refine projections and shed light on the ecological mechanisms that enable local persistence.},

To investigate how the large-scale circulation influenced the microphysics of this intense precipitation event, we used radar measurements, snowflake photographs and radiosounding data from the International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (ICE-POP 2018). The WCB was identified with trajectories computed with analysis wind fields from the Integrated Forecast System global atmospheric model. The WCB was collocated with a zone of enhanced wind speed of up to 45\&thinsp;m s−1 at 6500\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;a.s.l., as measured by a radiosonde and a Doppler radar. Supercooled liquid water (SLW) with concentrations exceeding 0.2\&thinsp;g kg−1 was produced during the rapid ascent within the WCB. During the most intense precipitation period, vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables show a peak and subsequent decrease in differential reflectivity as aggregation starts. Below the peak in differential reflectivity, the specific differential phase shift continues to increase, indicating early riming of oblate crystals and secondary ice generation. We hypothesise that the SLW produced in the WCB led to intense riming. Moreover, embedded updraughts in the WCB and turbulence at its lower boundary enhanced aggregation by increasing the probability of collisions between particles. This suggests that both aggregation and riming occurred prominently in this WCB. This case study shows how the large-scale atmospheric flow of a WCB provides ideal conditions for rapid precipitation growth involving SLW production, riming and aggregation. Future microphysical studies should also investigate the synoptic conditions to understand how observed processes in clouds are related to large-scale circulation.},

	abstract = {A broad consensus has been reached on the need to adapt the management of our forests to the context of the rapidly changing climate, which resulted in the development of numerous models capable of simulating the impact of the climate change on the forest. The primary goal of this specific endeavor is to propose a novel framework of comparative analysis which could lead to the unique and universal description and mapping of these models. This framework is based on the reduction of the model output to the relatively simplistic information about the presence of the tree species suitable for the forest management i.e.,—a binary classifier, making it comparable with the largely available tree presence observations. The framework we propose comes along with a new score, based on the joint use of the Principal Component Analysis and the Co-inertia Analysis, which evaluates the model vis-á-vis the corresponding observations with the focus on its phase space dynamics, i.e., its dependence on external environmental variables, rather than its spatial precision. The pertinence of the proposed multi-scale approach, suitable for the multi-scale analysis, is demonstrated by conjointly using prototype binary classifiers, designed for this purpose, and two different examples of binary classifiers used in the forest management—climate-dependent tree species distribution models. This work has the ambition to serve as the basis for a potential combination of different models at different spatial scales in order to improve the decision-making process in the forest management.},

Here we present a two decades long (2004\&ndash;2024), 30 m resolution annual canopy height dataset for Italy, developed using a time-series deep learning framework that integrates Landsat optical imagery with LiDAR observations. Two UNET models were independently trained using canopy height reference data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne LiDAR mission. Annual canopy height predictions from each model were fused using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to enhance spatial consistency and temporal continuity. Validation against ground-based measurements from the Italian National Forest Inventory (NFI) demonstrated high predictive accuracy (mean absolute error = 3.98 m). To further evaluate the utility of our dataset, we derived a canopy height change-based disturbance product and validated it against observed events (mean precision = 0.64 for 2005\&ndash;2016). In addition, we assessed post-disturbance recovery by monitoring canopy height regrowth in areas affected during 2004\&ndash;2005, tracking changes annually through 2024 across various Italian biomes. Our results highlight the importance of integrating multi-source remote sensing data with deep learning and Bayesian data fusion for monitoring forest structural dynamics. The final dataset is publicly available via Zenodo and provides a reproducible and scalable resource to support forest research, ecological monitoring, and climate-related policy-making.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel framework for estimating eddy fluxes using cross-scalogram smoothing, addressing key limitations of the standard eddy-covariance method. The standard approach suffers from fixed averaging times (typically 30 min) and limited frequency resolution, which can lead to biases and an inability to capture fast dynamics. Our method, based on wavelet transforms, allows for high-resolution analysis of fluxes in both time and frequency domains. It adaptively localises turbulent scales using a metric derived from the vertical component of the Reynolds stress tensor, enabling more accurate flux estimation under varying turbulence conditions. The proposed metric is similar to the u* and σw tests, but it is adapted to the time–frequency setting. By decoupling the filtering of perturbative scales from flux calculations, our approach allows for flexible averaging times. This adaptability makes it particularly suitable for studying rapid ecosystem responses to environmental changes, such as those occurring on timescales shorter than 1 h. We show application of the framework at the beech forest site Hesse (code FR-Hes) and demonstrate its relation with standard eddy-covariance calculations. The proposed method allows for varying the averaging time without impacting the filtering of the perturbative scales. It thus allows for producing estimates of CO2, latent heat, and sensible heat fluxes with faster dynamics (e.g. with 1, 10, and 30 min averaging time). We present statistics of the 10 min averaged fluxes and show that they align well with estimates of the 30 min standard eddy-covariance method. The improved localisation of turbulent scales results in higher estimates of carbon uptake during summer (+2 ± 1 µmolm-2s-1) and a more accurate assessment of nighttime respiration compared to standard eddy-covariance estimates. The methodology is implemented in the Julia package TurbulenceFlux.jl, making it readily accessible for practical applications.},

Two UNET models were developed: one trained on Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data (MAE: 1.22 m), while another using Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) footprints (MAE: 3.24 m). External validation with 6,308 Spanish National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots (2017–2019) confirmed canopy height reliability, showing MAEs of 2–3 m in tree-covered areas. AGB estimates were obtained through Random Forest models that linked UNET derived height predictions to NFI AGB data, achieves an MAE of {\textasciitilde}29 Mg/ha. The creation of high-resolution maps of canopy height and biomass across various forest landscapes in the Iberian Peninsula provides a valuable new tool for environmental researchers, policy makers, and forest management professionals, offering detailed insights that can inform conservation strategies, carbon sequestration efforts, and sustainable forest management practices.},

Yet, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the respective contributions of species richness, species identity and abundance to overall biomass change, and how the environment filters these processes. Synthesizing 11 years of data from a biodiversity experiment and from farmed grasslands in central Europe across a gradient of plant species richness and land-use intensity, we show that local arthropod biomass declines were predominantly ({\textgreater}90\%) linked to species richness losses. Abundance declines among persisting species accounted for only 5–8\% of lost biomass. The role of species identity depended on the environment and diminished over time: especially under high plant diversity and low land-use intensity, arthropod species with both below-average total biomass and above-average individual biomass (large, rare species) contributed disproportionately to species turnover—but this was only detectable in early years when the communities were still relatively abundant. We conclude that arthropod communities are currently homogenizing towards few common species of similar biomass, probably reducing their adaptability to future environmental change. Increasing the diversity and reducing the land-use intensity of grasslands may mitigate ongoing community simplification and loss of arthropod diversity and functioning.},

	abstract = {Managing forests to sustain their diversity and functioning is a major challenge in a changing world. Despite the key role of understory vegetation in driving forest biodiversity, regeneration and functioning, few studies address the functional dimensions of understory vegetation response to silvicultural management. We assessed the influence of the silvicultural regimes on the functional diversity and redundancy of European forest understory. We gathered vascular plant abundance data from more than 2000 plots in European forests, each associated with one out of the five most widespread silvicultural regimes. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess the effect of different silvicultural regimes on understory functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) and functional redundancy, while accounting for climate and soil conditions, and explored the reciprocal relationship between three diversity components (functional diversity, redundancy and dominance) across silvicultural regimes through a ternary diversity diagram. Intensive silvicultural regimes are associated with a decrease in functional diversity and an increase in functional redundancy, compared with unmanaged conditions. This means that although intensive management may buffer communities' functions against species or functional losses, it also limits the range of understory response to environmental changes. Policy implications. Different silvicultural regimes influence different facets of understory functional features. While unmanaged forests can be used as a reference to design silvicultural practices in compliance with biodiversity conservation targets, different silvicultural options should be balanced at landscape scale to sustain the multiple forest functions that human societies are increasingly demanding.},

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification has simplified landscape composition and configuration, which has led to biodiversity declines. Increasing landscape-wide crop heterogeneity can promote farmland biodiversity. However, knowledge is still lacking on how the effects of configurational and compositional crop heterogeneity (i.e. field size and crop diversity) are modulated by the amount of semi-natural habitats in the landscape, especially across large scales. We tested how mean field size and functional crop diversity affect farmland bird diversity and abundance over three consecutive years, and how these effects are modulated by the amount of small woody features (SWF) in the landscape. We related data from a national bird monitoring scheme to field-level information from a novel, high-resolution remote sensing-based crop type map. Smaller field sizes and higher functional crop diversity were not generally associated with a higher diversity or abundance of farmland birds. Associations varied with species' breeding habitat preferences and were modulated by the amount of SWF. In landscapes with a low SWF amount, species diversity and the abundance of species breeding in field edges or shrubs were negatively associated with increasing field size. However, where the amount of SWF was high, larger field size was associated with higher species diversity and abundance of field and shrub breeders. Diversity increased with higher functional crop diversity, as did the abundance of non-field breeders in landscapes with a medium to high SWF amount. Field size tended to have a stronger effect on bird diversity and abundance than functional crop diversity. Policy implications: National and EU agricultural policies should adopt a landscape perspective by considering the amount of semi-natural habitats when designing biodiversity-enhancing measures that target field size and functional crop diversity. In landscapes with low SWF amount, decreasing field sizes may be particularly effective to promote farmland bird diversity and the abundance of non-field breeders. In landscapes with a medium to high SWF amount, increasing functional crop diversity is likely more effective than reducing field sizes. Field and shrub breeders may be promoted by maintaining landscapes with large fields, only if these offer a high SWF amount, low agronomic yield potential and low productivity.},

	abstract = {Forests account for 80\% of the total carbon exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, to better manage our responses to global warming, it is important to monitor and assess forest aboveground carbon and forest aboveground biomass (FAGB). Different levels of detail are needed to estimate FAGB at local, regional and national scales. Multi-scale remote sensing analysis from high, medium and coarse spatial resolution data, along with field sampling, is one approach often used. However, the methods developed are still time consuming, expensive, and inconvenient for systematic monitoring, especially for developing countries, as they require vast numbers of field samples for upscaling. Here, we recommend a convenient two-scale approach to estimate FAGB that was tested in our study sites. The study was conducted in the Chitwan district of Nepal using GeoEye-1 (0.5 m), Landsat (30 m) and Google Earth very high resolution (GEVHR) Quickbird (0.65 m) images. For the local scale (Kayerkhola watershed), tree crowns of the area were delineated by the object-based image analysis technique on GeoEye images. An overall accuracy of 83\% was obtained in the delineation of tree canopy cover (TCC) per plot. A TCC vs. FAGB model was developed based on the TCC estimations from GeoEye and FAGB measurements from field sample plots. A coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76 was obtained in the modelling, and a value of 0.83 was obtained in the validation of the model. To upscale FAGB to the entire district, open source GEVHR images were used as virtual field plots. We delineated their TCC values and then calculated FAGB based on a TCC versus FAGB model. Using the multivariate adaptive regression splines machine learning algorithm, we developed a model from the relationship between the FAGB of GEVHR virtual plots with predictor parameters from Landsat 8 bands and vegetation indices. The model was then used to extrapolate FAGB to the entire district. This approach considerably reduced the need for field data and commercial very high resolution imagery while achieving two-scale forest information and FAGB estimates at high resolution (30 m) and accuracy (R2 = 0.76 and 0.7) with minimal error (RMSE = 64 and 38 tons ha−1) at local and regional scales. This methodology is a promising technique for cost-effective FAGB and carbon estimations and can be replicated with limited resources and time. The method is especially applicable for developing countries that have low budgets for carbon estimations, and it is also applicable to the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) monitoring reporting and verification processes.},

The reference data were used for tuning the software settings by leave-one-out cross validation method. The obtained root mean square error was below 10 kg/m3 (1.7\%) for the 5 mm cores.

	abstract = {Calibration of local, regional or global allometric equations to estimate biomass at the tree level constitutes a significant burden on projects aiming at reducing Carbon emissions from forest degradation and deforestation. The objective of this contribution is to assess the precision and accuracy of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) for estimating volumes and above-ground biomass (AGB) of the woody parts of tropical trees, and for the calibration of allometric models. We used a destructive dataset of 61 trees, with diameters and AGB of up to 186.6 cm and 60 Mg respectively, which were scanned, felled and weighed in the semi-deciduous forests of eastern Cameroon. We present an operational approach based on available software allowing the retrieving of TLS volume with low bias and high accuracy for large tropical trees. Edition of the obtained models proved necessary, mainly to account for the complexity of buttressed parts of tree trunks, which were separately modelled through a meshing approach, and to bring a few corrections in the topology and geometry of branches, thanks to the amapstudio-scan software. Over the entire dataset, TLS-derived volumes proved highly reliable for branches larger than 5 cm in diameter. The volumes of the remaining woody parts estimated for stumps, stems and crowns as well as for the whole tree proved very accurate (RMSE below 2.81\% and R² above of .98) and unbiased. Once converted into AGB using mean local-specific wood density values, TLS estimates allowed calibrating a biomass allometric model with coefficients statistically undistinguishable from those of a model based on destructive data. The Unedited Quantitative Structure Model (QSM) however leads to systematic overestimations of woody volumes and subsequently to significantly different allometric parameters. We can therefore conclude that a non-destructive TLS approach can now be used as an operational alternative to traditional destructive sampling to build the allometric equations, although attention must be paid to the quality of QSM model adjustments to avoid systematic bias.},

It is time to inspect the achievements of and the remaining barriers to TLS-based forest investigations, so further research and application are clearly orientated in operational uses of TLS. In such context, the international TLS benchmarking project was launched in 2014 by the European Spatial Data Research Organization and coordinated by the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute. The main objectives of this benchmarking study are to evaluate the potential of applying TLS in characterizing forests, to clarify the strengths and the weaknesses of TLS as a measure of forest digitization, and to reveal the capability of recent algorithms for tree-attribute extraction. The project is designed to benchmark the TLS algorithms by processing identical TLS datasets for a standardized set of forest attribute criteria and by evaluating the results through a common procedure respecting reliable references. Benchmarking results reflect large variances in estimating accuracies, which were unveiled through the 18 compared algorithms and through the evaluation framework, i.e., forest complexity categories, TLS data acquisition approaches, tree attributes and evaluation procedures. The evaluation framework includes three new criteria proposed in this benchmarking and the algorithm performances are investigated through combining two or more criteria (e.g., the accuracy of the individual tree attributes are inspected in conjunction with plot-level completeness) in order to reveal algorithms’ overall performance. The results also reveal some best available forest attribute estimates at this time, which clarify the status quo of TLS-based forest investigations. Some results are well expected, while some are new, e.g., the variances of estimating accuracies between single-/multi-scan, the principle of the algorithm designs and the possibility of a computer outperforming human operation. With single-scan data, i.e., one hemispherical scan per plot, most of the recent algorithms are capable of achieving stem detection with approximately 75\% completeness and 90\% correctness in the easy forest stands (easy plots: 600 stems/ha, 20 cm mean DBH). The detection rate decreases when the stem density increases and the average DBH decreases, i.e., 60\% completeness with 90\% correctness (medium plots: 1000 stem/ha, 15 cm mean DBH) and 30\% completeness with 90\% correctness (difficult plots: 2000 stems/ha, 10 cm mean DBH). The application of the multi-scan approach, i.e., five scans per plot at the center and four quadrant angles, is more effective in complex stands, increasing the completeness to approximately 90\% for medium plots and to approximately 70\% for difficult plots, with almost 100\% correctness. The results of this benchmarking also show that the TLS-based approaches can provide the estimates of the DBH and the stem curve at a 1–2 cm accuracy that are close to what is required in practical applications, e.g., national forest inventories (NFIs). In terms of algorithm development, a high level of automation is a commonly shared standard, but a bottleneck occurs at stem detection and tree height estimation, especially in multilayer and dense forest stands. The greatest challenge is that even with the multi-scan approach, it is still hard to completely and accurately record stems of all trees in a plot due to the occlusion effects of the trees and bushes in forests. Future development must address the redundant yet incomplete point clouds of forest sample plots and recognize trees more accurately and efficiently. It is worth noting that TLS currently provides the best quality terrestrial point clouds in comparison with all other technologies, meaning that all the benchmarks labeled in this paper can also serve as a reference for other terrestrial point clouds sources.},

	abstract = {The length of the fire cycle is a critical factor affecting the vegetation cover in boreal and temperate regions. However, its responses to climate change remain poorly understood. We reanalyzed data from earlier studies of forest age structures at the landscape level, in order to map the evolution of regional fire cycles across Eastern North American boreal and temperate forests, following the termination of the Little Ice Age (LIA). We demonstrated a well-defined spatial pattern of post-LIA changes in the length of fire cycles toward lower fire activity during the 1800s and 1900s. The western section of Eastern North America (west of 77°W) experienced a decline in fire activity as early as the first half of the 1800s. By contrast, the eastern section showed these declines as late as the early 1900s. During a regionally fire-prone period of the 1910s–1920s, forests in the western section of Eastern boreal North America burned more than forests in the eastern section. The climate appeared to dominate over vegetation composition and human impacts in shaping the geographical pattern of the post-LIA change in fire activity. Changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns following the termination of the LIA, specifically changes in Arctic Oscillation and the strengthening of the Continental Polar Trough, were likely drivers of the regional fire dynamics.},

	abstract = {Climate change modulates cold-marginal forest ecosystems through changing growth constraints. Understanding spatiotemporal variations in climate–growth relationships is essential to project forest ecosystem dynamics, and climate–environmental feedbacks. We explored variations in growth and climate–growth relationships, along the Arctic margin in north-western Europe, using Scots pine radial growth chronologies, climate data and links between the geographical origin of dominant air masses and growth-controlling variables. Analyses covered nineteenth century to early twenty-first century, with emphasis on two separate warming periods (early twentieth century, and late twentieth to early twenty-first century) and the intervening cooling period. The analyses revealed spatiotemporally unstable growth responses to climate along the Arctic margin. Spatial growth patterns were most similar during the cooling period. However, climate trends (warming, cooling) were weak drivers of growth-limiting climate variables. Instead, a transition in growth-limiting variables occurred throughout the analysed period. A wide range of growing season and non-growing season climate variables limited growth during the early twentieth century. Thereafter the number of growth-limiting variables progressively decreased. This change was accompanied by a contraction in the spatial correspondence between growth and climate, and by a shift in the geographical origin of dominant air masses. This was particularly emphasized close to the Atlantic during recent warming period. The weak association between growth-limiting variables and climate trends question projections of future ecosystem dynamics based on climate variables identified during specific periods (for example, recent warming period). Such projections may be misleading as the diversity of climate conditions constraining cold-marginal forests will be underestimated.},

	abstract = {When stumps on clear cuts are harvested for bioenergy, retention of a share of them is recommended to mitigate environmental issues. To maximise benefits for the diversity of saproxylic beetles, retention should be done in dry positions. Saproxylic dipterans are usually thought to be associated with wetter wood substrates. We therefore hypothesised that dipterans would benefit from other recommendations. We tested that by rearing out insects from spruce and birch stumps sampled in clear fellings, and received a material of 866 individuals of 24 Diptera taxa. Among six Diptera species tested statistically, one was associated with dry stumps when comparing within spruce, and the total abundance of dipterans was higher in dry spruce stumps than in wet. No parameter (total species number, species number per stump, total abundances and abundances of individual species) showed a higher value for wet stumps than for dry. We conclude that there are several Diptera species that frequently use stumps, of which a large share was earlier regarded as very rare. For those, our hypothesis was falsified, as the affinities to dry stumps seem similar as for beetles and the same recommendations could be used.},

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change on high-latitude forest ecosystems are still uncertain. Divergent forest productivity trends have recently been reported both at the local and regional level challenging the projections of boreal tree growth dynamics. The present study investigated (i) the responses of different forest productivity proxies to monthly climate (temperature and precipitation) through space and time; and (ii) the local coherency between these proxies through time at four high-latitude boreal Scots pine sites (coastal and inland) in Norway. Forest productivity proxies consisted of two proxies representing stem growth dynamics (radial and height growth) and one proxy representing canopy dynamics (cumulative May-to-September Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)). Between-proxy and climate-proxy correlations were computed over the 1982–2011 period and over two 15-yr sub-periods. Over the entire period, radial growth significantly correlated with current year July temperature, and height growth and cumulative NDVI significantly correlated with previous and current growing season temperatures. Significant climate responses were quite similar across sites, despite some higher sensitivity to non-growing season climate at inland sites. Significant climate-proxy correlations identified over the entire period were temporarily unstable. Local coherency between proxies was generally insignificant. The spatiotemporal instability in climate-proxy correlations observed for all proxies underlines evolving responses to climate and challenges the modelling of forest productivity. The general lack of local coherency between proxies at our four study sites suggests that forest productivity estimations based on a single proxy should be considered with great caution. The combined use of different forest growth metrics may help circumvent uncertainties in capturing responses of forest productivity to climate variability and improve estimations of carbon sequestration by forest ecosystems.},

But it remains less clear whether this pattern also holds for other ecosystems such as forests, and if so why. 2. Here we explore whether diversity effects on tree growth change predictably during stand development in Finland's boreal forests. Using tree ring records from mature forests, we tested whether diameter growth trajectories of dominant tree species growing in mixture differed from those in monoculture. We then compared these results with data from the world's longest running tree diversity experiment, where the same combinations of species sampled in mature forests were planted in 1999. 3. We found that diversity effects on tree growth strengthened progressively through time, only becoming significantly positive around 20 years after seedling establishment. This shift coincided with the period in which canopy closure occurs in these forests, at which time trees begin to interact and compete above-ground. These temporal trends were remarkably consistent across different tree species sampled in mature forests, and broadly matched growth responses observed in the much younger experimental plots. 4. Synthesis. Our results mirror those from grassland ecosystems and suggest that canopy closure is a key phase for promoting niche complementarity in diverse tree communities. They also provide a series of testable hypotheses for the growing number of tree diversity experiments that have been established in recent years.},

We have developed a spatially explicit dendrochronological reconstruction of a fire regime in a 25 × 50 km2 area within boreal biome located within the Kalevalsky National Park (Kalevalsky NP), over the 1400–2010 CE period. We dated 184 fire years using 212 fire-scarred living and dead Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees collected on 38 sites. The studied period revealed a pronounced century-long variability in forest fire cycles (FC). The early period (1400–1620 CE) had low fire activity (FC = 178 years), which increased during the 1630–1920 period (FC = 46 years) and then decreased over the 1930–2000 period (FC = 283 years). Dendrochronological results did not provide a conclusive answer on the origins of FC dynamics, although several lines of evidence suggest that climate drove the increase in fire activity in the early 1600s, while human-related factors were largely responsible for its decline in the early 1900s. The current FC in the Kalevalsky NP is close to the estimates reported for the pre-industrial colonisation period in Scandinavia, which suggests that the forests of the area currently maintain their close-to-natural fire regime. Fire has been the pivotal factor of forest dynamics in this biome and forest management should acknowledge that fact in developing conservation strategies in Karelia and other areas of European boreal forest. Introduction of prescribed burns of varying severity could be an important element of such strategies.},

	abstract = {Wood resources have been essential for human welfare throughout history. Also nowadays, the volume of growing stock (GS) is considered one of the most important forest attributes monitored by National Forest Inventories (NFIs) to inform policy decisions and forest management planning. The origins of forest inventories closely relate to times of early wood shortage in Europe causing the need to explore and plan the utilisation of GS in the catchment areas of mines, saltworks and settlements. Over time, forest surveys became more detailed and their scope turned to larger areas, although they were still conceived as stand-wise inventories. In the 1920s, the first sample-based NFIs were introduced in the northern European countries. Since the earliest beginnings, GS monitoring approaches have considerably evolved. Current NFI methods differ due to country-specific conditions, inventory traditions, and information needs. Consequently, GS estimates were lacking international comparability and were therefore subject to recent harmonisation efforts to meet the increasing demand for consistent forest resource information at European level. As primary large-area monitoring programmes in most European countries, NFIs assess a multitude of variables, describing various aspects of sustainable forest management, including for example wood supply, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Many of these contemporary subject matters involve considerations about GS and its changes, at different geographic levels and time frames from past to future developments according to scenario simulations. Due to its historical, continued and currently increasing importance, we provide an up-to-date review focussing on large-area GS monitoring where we i) describe the origins and historical development of European NFIs, ii) address the terminology and present GS definitions of NFIs, iii) summarise the current methods of 23 European NFIs including sampling methods, tree measurements, volume models, estimators, uncertainty components, and the use of air- and space-borne data sources, iv) present the recent progress in NFI harmonisation in Europe, and v) provide an outlook under changing climate and forest-based bioeconomy objectives.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing availability of remote sensing data allows production of forest attributes maps, which are usually made using model-based approaches. These map products are sensitive to various bias sources, including model extrapolation. To identify, over a case study forest, the proportion of extrapolated predictions, we used a convex hull method applied to the auxiliary data space of an airborne laser scanning (ALS) flight. The impact of different sampling efforts was also evaluated. This was done by iteratively thinning a set of 487 systematic plots using nested sub-grids allowing to divide the sample by two at each level. The analysis were conducted for all alternative samples and evaluated against 56 independent validation plots. Residuals of the extrapolated validation plots were computed and examined as a function of their distance to the model calibration domain. Extrapolation was also characterized for the pixels of the area of interest (AOI) to upscale at population level. Results showed that the proportion of extrapolated pixels greatly reduced with an increasing sampling effort. It reached a plateau (ca. 20\% extrapolation) with a sampling intensity of ca. 250-calibration plots. This contrasts with results on model’s root mean squared error (RMSE), which reached a plateau at a much lower sampling intensity. This result emphasizes the fact that with a low sampling effort, extrapolation risk remains high, even at a relatively low RMSE. For all attributes examined (i.e., stand density, basal area, and quadratic mean diameter) estimations were generally found to be biased for validation plots that were extrapolated. The method allows an easy identification of map pixels that are out of the calibration domain, making it an interesting tool to evaluate model transferability over an area of interest (AOI). It could also serve to compare “competing” models at a variable selection phase. From a model calibration perspective, it could serve a posteriori, to evaluate areas (in the auxiliary space) that merit further sampling efforts to improve model reliability.},

	abstract = {Tree diversity and species identity are known to play an important role in modulating forest productivity and its capacity to buffer the effects of climatic events. The FunDivEurope exploratory platform allowed us to analyse this modulating effect in a medium-term time span, after an abrupt rise to a new stable level of the average summer temperature of ca 2°C, in Mediterranean forests in central Italy. This paper aims to answer the following questions: 1) did increasing temperature and drought events affect the growth of thermophilous deciduous forests? 2) Was this effect buffered in mixed stands compared to monocultures? 3) Did co-occurring tree species with different ecological characteristics, from more mesophilous to more xerophilous, have different responses? In 2012 and 2017, wood cores were collected from 659 trees in 36 plots representative of thermophilous deciduous forests. The selected tree species were Castanea sativa, Ostrya carpinifolia, Quercus cerris, Quercus ilex and Quercus petraea. In the sampling plots, they were present in pure stands and mixtures from two to four species. After measuring annual rings on cores, chronologies of basal area increment were built, and inventory data were used to estimate tree growth. Results showed a strong reduction of growth, lasting at least 18 years, after the temperature rise. Tree diversity significantly reduced the growth drop after the sudden and stable rise in summer average temperature. Tree mixture effect on growth stability appeared to be dependent on the tree species present in the mixture. Temperature rise and associated drought events, even without changes in rainfall, are one of the main challenges that European forests will face in the current scenarios of climate change. Tree diversity can buffer the effects of climate change over periods of at least 15 years and should be considered in forest management plans.},

	abstract = {Our aim was to investigate the possible enhancing role of long-term atmospheric CO2 increase on wood density as an essential component of biomass sequestration. We therefore assessed the long-term evolution of wood density over pre-industrial and contemporary periods, in a regional context free of management practices, atmospheric deposition and with restricted climatic change. Dominant trees of Araucaria araucana were sampled in 37 stands distributed throughout its natural distribution over temperate forests of the Chilean Andes Cordillera. Mean ring density (MRD) at 1.30 m was measured by X-ray micro-densitometry. A third-century MRD chronology was built after MRD standardisation by the effects of cambial age and radial growth, simultaneously estimated from a statistical model from rings of the pre-industrial period (1700–1850) to avoid any temporal bias. The age-alone standardised MRD chronology showed restricted fluctuations ranging between 2.0 and 3.2 \% over the last three centuries. Multi-decennial fluctuations between ring width and MRD were found qualitatively synchronous and opposed. Accordingly, MRD fluctuations were removed with the age and growth standardisation, highlighting the absence of a historical wood density trend at constant ring size over the whole period. Over the most recent decades however, a slight increase in density was identified, with loss of synchronisation to radial growth. The absence of a long-term signal in wood density of A. araucana, in a context of restricted anthropogenic influence, differs markedly from reports of significant decreases in the Northern Hemisphere. We conclude as part of the analysis done that until now, increasing atmospheric CO2 unlikely would have an impact in wood density.},

	abstract = {Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) is a state of the art technology to assess forest aboveground biomass (AGB). To date, methods developed to relate Lidar metrics with forest parameters were built upon the vertical component of the data. In multi-layered tropical forests, signal penetration might be restricted, limiting the efficiency of these methods. A potential way for improving AGB models in such forests would be to combine traditional approaches by descriptors of the horizontal canopy structure. We assessed the capability and complementarity of three recently proposed methods for assessing AGB at the plot level using point distributional approach (DM), canopy volume profile approach (CVP), 2D canopy grain approach (FOTO), and further evaluated the potential of a topographical complexity index (TCI) to explain part of the variability of AGB with slope. This research has been conducted in a mountainous wet evergreen tropical forest of Western Ghats in India. AGB biomass models were developed using a best subset regression approach, and model performance was assessed through cross-validation. Results demonstrated that the variability in AGB could be efficiently captured when variables describing both the vertical (DM or CVP) and horizontal (FOTO) structure were combined. Integrating FOTO metrics with those of either DM or CVP decreased the root mean squared error of the models by 4.42\% and 6.01\%, respectively. These results are of high interest for AGB mapping in the tropics and could significantly contribute to the REDD+ program. Model quality could be further enhanced by improving the robustness of field-based biomass models and influence of topography on area-based Lidar descriptors of the forest structure.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture and nutritional characteristics are frequently assessed using plant species and community bioindication, e.g., the Ellenberg system of species indicator values. This method, based on complete inventories of plant species present in plots, is time-consuming, which could prevent its general use for forest or other natural land management. Our aim was to determine the impact of a reduction in the time spent to carry out a floristic inventory on the quality of soil characteristic assessment using plant bioindication. We compared the measurements of soil pH-H2O (pH), organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C:N) and base saturation (BS) in the 0–5cm soil layer of 470 plots with the same variables estimated from floristic inventories of increasing duration, using plant indicator values (IV) from the EcoPlant database. The performance of predictions was evaluated by the square of the linear correlation coefficient between measured and predicted values (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of predictions. The number rather than the percentage of total plot species used for the estimations was determinant for the prediction of soil pH quality. Performance of bioindication of pH, BS and C:N reached the maximum R2 using the first 20–25 species recorded per plot, corresponding to a 14-min-long floristic inventory in comparison to a mean of 28min spent to carry out a complete floristic inventory. A precision of prediction of 80\% of the maximal precision was obtained after 4–5min (6–12 inventoried species) for the three studied variables. These results are independent of the nutritional capability of the soils and were similar at the national and local scales. In order to estimate soil nutritional resources by plant bioindication, it is feasible to significantly reduce the time spent on floristic inventories and, thus, their cost. This is especially useful when the goal is to map the soil quality for decision-making in forest management.},

	abstract = {The growth of high-latitude temperature-limited boreal forest ecosystems is projected to become more constrained by soil water availability with continued warming. The purpose of this study was to document ongoing shifts in tree growth sensitivity to the evolving local climate in unmanaged black spruce (Picea mariana (Miller) B.S.P.) forests of eastern boreal North America (49°N–52°N, 58°W–82°W) using a comparative study of field and modeled data. We investigated growth relationships to climate (gridded monthly data) from observed (50 site tree-ring width chronologies) and simulated growth data (stand-level forest growth model) over 1908–2013. No clear strengthening of moisture control over tree growth in recent decades was detected. Despite climate warming, photosynthesis (main driver of the forest growth model) and xylem production (main driver of radial growth) have remained temperature-limited. Analyses revealed, however, a weakening of the influence of growing season temperature on growth during the mid- to late twentieth century in the observed data, particularly in high-latitude ({\textgreater} 51.5°N) mountainous sites. This shift was absent from simulated data, which resulted in clear model-data desynchronization. Thorough investigations revealed that desynchronization was mostly linked to the quality of climate data, with precipitation data being of particular concern. The scarce network of weather stations over eastern boreal North America ({\textgreater} 51.5°N) affects the accuracy of estimated local climate variability and critically limits our ability to detect climate change effects on high-latitude ecosystems, especially at high altitudinal sites. Climate estimates from remote sensing could help address some of these issues in the future.},

However, recent studies have reported opposite or inconsistent latitudinal trends in the bottom-up (plant quality) and top-down (natural enemies) forces driving herbivory. In addition, these forces have rarely been studied together thus limiting previous attempts to understand the effect of large-scale climatic gradients on herbivory. Location Europe. Time period 2018–2019. Major taxa studied Quercus robur. Methods We simultaneously tested for latitudinal variation in plant–herbivore–natural enemy interactions. We further investigated the underlying climatic factors associated with variation in herbivory, leaf chemistry and attack rates in Quercus robur across its complete latitudinal range in Europe. We quantified insect leaf damage and the incidence of specialist herbivores as well as leaf chemistry and bird attack rates on dummy caterpillars on 261 oak trees. Results Climatic factors rather than latitude per se were the best predictors of the large-scale (geographical) variation in the incidence of gall-inducers and leaf-miners as well as in leaf nutritional content. However, leaf damage, plant chemical defences (leaf phenolics) and bird attack rates were not influenced by climatic factors or latitude. The incidence of leaf-miners increased with increasing concentrations of hydrolysable tannins, whereas the incidence of gall-inducers increased with increasing leaf soluble sugar concentration and decreased with increasing leaf C : N ratios and lignins. However, leaf traits and bird attack rates did not vary with leaf damage. Main conclusions These findings help to refine our understanding of the bottom-up and top-down mechanisms driving geographical variation in plant–herbivore interactions, and indicate the need for further examination of the drivers of herbivory on trees.},

	abstract = {Climate warming-related drought could become a major driver of large-scale forest dieback. However, little is known about how past management legacies modulate the climate-growth responses during recent dieback episodes in central European oak forests. Here, we examine the role played by past management –unmanaged old-growth vs. managed forests– in recent tree mortality events occurring in Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. stands across large areas of western Romania. We analyze how stand structure (tree size, competition) and climatic factors (drought, temperature and precipitation) drive tree radial growth patterns in neighboring standing dead and living trees. We analyzed basal area increments (BAI) trends, past management legacies and climate- and drought-growth relationships during the 20th century to distinguish the roles and interactions on recent warming-induced dieback. We observed that temperature rises and changes in atmospheric water demand during growing season let to increasing drought stress during the late 20th century affecting both managed and unmanaged forests. Dead trees from old-growth and managed forests showed lower growth than living trees after dieback onset. In both forests, dead and living trees displayed divergent growth patterns after dry 1980s, indicating that dieback was triggered by severe extreme conditions. Dead trees from managed stands experienced significant stronger growth reductions after 1980s though they experienced less tree-to-tree competition than dead trees in old-growth forest. High stand density negatively drove growth and enhanced climate sensitivity in old-growth stands. Competition acted synergistically with climate warming and drought causing tree mortality regardless of the management legacies in of Q. petraea forests. Our retrospective assessment of growth rates in relation with climate and structure changes offers valuable information for further forest conservation and management decisions of Q. petraea forests. These findings highlight the importance of past uses legacies driving recent forest dieback in temperate oak forests, making them more vulnerable under forecasted climate-warming related droughts in central Europe.},

	abstract = {The objective was to quantify the influence of thinning, high pruning and slash management on crop tree and stand growth in young even-aged stands of planted silver birch (Betula pendula Roth). This study was based on two field experiments, aged six and eleven years at initiation and re-measured after six and eight years, respectively. Treatments included the unthinned control, moderate thinning mainly from below (removing 28–33\% of standing volume), point thinning to favor 300 trees per ha and with no thinning elsewhere in the plot (removing 16–25\%), and heavy thinning leaving 600 evenly distributed potential future crop trees per ha (removing 64–75\%). Slash management (extraction or retention) was applied to heavily thinned plots. High pruning removing 30–70\% of the green crown was carried out in some plots with point or heavy thinning on 300 or 600 trees per ha, respectively. Stand volume growth increased with increasing pre-treatment mean annual volume increment and decreased with increasing thinning intensity as compared to the unthinned control. LS-means estimates indicated a reduction for moderate thinning by 14\%, for point thinning by 12\% and for heavy thinning (combined with pruning) by 62\%. However, in the youngest experiment, heavy thinning (without pruning) reduced growth by 54\%. Combining these results with results from a similar experiment in Canada, the reduction in stand volume growth (RedIv\%) depending on thinning removal (RemV\%), both expressed as a percentage of the unthinned control, was quantified as RedIv\% = −23.67 + 1.16·RemV\% (calibration range: 30–83\%). For heavy thinning (large quantities of slash), slash extraction resulted in no reduction in stand volume growth as compared to slash retention. The instantaneous numeric reduction in the average stem diameter of the 300 thickest trees per ha (D300) due to thinning was 3.5, 15–21\% and 955–11\% with moderate, point and heavy thinning, respectively. The subsequent average annual increase in D300 during the observation period was 8.5\%, 25 and 18\%, respectively. In the youngest experiment, pruning in unthinned plots led to a reduction in the annual increase of D300 by 14\%, and heavy thinning in unpruned plots led to an increase by 30\%. The growth of pre-selected potential future crop trees increased with increasing thinning intensity. In heavily thinned plots, pruning reduced growth increasingly with increasing pruning severity; LS-means estimates indicated 21\% larger growth on stem diameter for unpruned trees and 3\% for pruned trees. As an adverse side effect, heavily thinned plots with only 600 trees per ha were at increased risk of windthrow for some years after the thinning intervention. In the oldest experiment, 95–21\% of the trees in these plots were damaged by wind.},

With growing awareness of GCR influence on global cloudiness (the cosmoclimatologic theory by H. Svensmark), GCR may thus cause trends in diffuse-light, and distinguishing between their direct/indirect influences on forest growth remains uncertain. This link between cosmic rays and diffuse sunlight also forms an alternative explanation to the geological evidence of a negative correlation between GCR and atmospheric CO2 concentration over the past 500 Myr. After a careful scrutiny of this literature and of key contributions in the field, we draw research options to progress further in this attribution. These include i) observational strategies intending to build on differences in the spatio-temporal dynamics of environmental growth factors, ranging from quasi-experiments to meta-analyses, ii) simulation strategies intending to quantify environmental factor's effects based on process-based ecosystem modelling, in a context where progresses for accounting for diffuse-light fraction are ongoing. Also, the hunt for tree-ring based proxies of GCR may offer the perspective of testing the GCR hypothesis on fully coupled forest growth samples.},
