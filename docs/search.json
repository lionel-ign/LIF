However, forest inventories face major challenges, and there is a need to provide detailed, accurate, regular, and real-time information on forest condition and management, with open access. MONITOR will deliver new methods and tools, as well as validation protocols, paving the way for the implementation of a high-resolution, multi-source, national forest monitoring system for France, including its overseas territories. The methodology is based on satellite and ground-based data and will be directly applicable to other regions.

Existing studies, for instance, focus on the economic risk following the occurrence of a storm (a drop in timber prices), the environmental risk associated with a wildfire (carbon release, loss of biodiversity), or the impact of geopolitical risks on the supply of the forest-based sector (supply contraction, price increases, substitution effects).\nHowever, in a context of global change, this assumption of independence between risks is no longer relevant. Risks are becoming interconnected, correlated, cascading, and mutually dependent, both temporally and spatially. Addressing the issue of multiple risks therefore becomes a matter of critical importance and calls for a paradigm shift, new tools, and innovative approaches to better inform strategies and guide action.\n      \n        Website: \n        https://www.pepr-forestt.fr/projets/pc-x-risks\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        ● \n        RÉGÉ-ADAPT – Forest Regeneration and Renewal for the Adaptation of Forest Socio-Ecological Systems to Climate Change\n      \n      PEPR Forestt · 6 years · 2024–2030\n      \n        PI: \n        Georges Kunstler, INRAE; Bruno Locatelli, CIRAD\n      \n      \n        LIF staff: \n        Lionel Hertzog, Scientific contact for Géodata Paris and Task co-leader\n      \n      Climate change is affecting the capacity of forests to provide nature’s contributions to people (NCP), such as timber production or watershed regulation, as well as to support biodiversity. The future adaptation and resilience of forest socio-ecological systems will depend on forest renewal and regeneration—that is, the natural or artificial re-establishment of trees following natural disturbances or harvests. Regeneration trajectories will depend not only on ecological processes but also on management choices, which should reflect societal preferences and values as well as governance contexts.\nWe need a better understanding of how regeneration trajectories will unfold under ongoing climate change, how we can manage them to promote forest adaptation while preserving biodiversity, soils, and NCP, and how regeneration can be governed.

This dataset will then be used to impute forest attributes across the full set of GEDI signals. The ability to generate realistic forest scenes from TLS data as inputs to DART for LiDAR signal simulation has already been demonstrated within the TOSCA STEM-LEAF and LEAF-EXPEVAL projects. The resulting virtual plots will contribute to densifying the inventory sampling, either by improving predictions at the national scale or by enabling predictions with acceptable uncertainty levels for small-area domains. Sentinel-2 data will then be integrated as auxiliary variables within a more classical multi-source inventory framework. This project aims to deliver an operational method deployable at the national level.

This integration strenghened our integration to the local research ecosystem, supporting collaborations ans the development of coordinated research activity. The consortium agreement expired in 2024.\n\n\n2018\nLIF became part of the DEEPSURF I-SITE LUE consortium (PIA #3), contributing to the emergence of a research community focused on natural resources and energy, while further strengthening project-based funding.\n\n\n2019\nThe laboratory was integrated into the SiReNa Doctoral School of the University of Lorraine, enabling PhD project management and formal recognition by the university’s administrative council.\n\n\n2022\nFollowing LABEX ARBRE, LIF joined the interdisciplinary ARTEMIS program, which supports ecological and industrial transitions through adaptation to and mitigation of global change in forest socio-ecosystems.\n\n\n2023\nLIF signed a 5 years partnership with INRAE, department ECODIV, through a convention of contract unit (USC). This partnership favours project collaboration in larger national Clusters.\n\n\n2025\nA cooperation agreement between GéoData Paris and AgroParisTech is signed to establish a joint final-year engineering program. Formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2025, the program aims to train students in forest inventory, decision-support approaches, and resource information, with the first cohort starting in the 2026 academic year.\nLIF also signed a partnership with the University of Lorraine aimed at developing cooperation in the fields of research, higher education, and innovation."
